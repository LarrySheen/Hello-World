# Hello-World
a test demo.\n
Therefore I'd like to make new electron project for my server of SAMP(Role Play), to maintain a safety and equal community for players, behavior such as hacking and trolling in-game would do nothing healthy but makes people angry and leaving, here is a plan to slove those problems of mine.
Project includes:
Server Side Solution(Java & Tomcat services with HTTP request method): 
/*
manner registrations and BAN-lists, filter of client folders to make sure they don't have any hacking scripts(cleo&.asi for GTA_SA) inside of the client files to connect into the server. Once they passed the detection and log in, it's more safety to manner actions of hacking(memory injection applications, but nothing related to the function of multiplayer or threats towards other players. Even there is someway to make it happen, it will take a lots of work to develop and redesign.)
*/
Client Side Solution(Electron&DLL Injection):
/*
to collect folders information and IP address(Physical Address of Network such as "MAC" or ID of the network controller&system)of clients were the final motivate to design it. Those method will related towards process of register & connect, if there is some actions of hacking&trolling in-game, against the information they used to registed, they will be banned with those identification more precise.
*/
